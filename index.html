  <h1>This is Italy!</h1>
<p>Italy is a nation in south-central Europe that sits atop a peninsula jutting far into the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is frequently referred to be a boot-shaped country since it has some of the most diverse and beautiful landscapes on the planet. The Alps, one of the most untamed mountain ranges in the world, are situated at its broad top. The highest points in Italy are located along Mont Blanc, which has a peak in France, and along Monte Rosa, which has a peak in Switzerland. The Po River and the Piedmont can be seen below the Alpine lakes and valleys carved out by glaciers that are visible from the western Alps. The most well-known region in the nation is perhaps Tuscany, which is south of the Cisalpine region. The lofty Apennine Range emanates from the middle Alps and spans the entire length of the nation. The lofty Apennine Range, which extends from the central Alps and along the length of the nation, widens around Rome to encircle almost the whole width of the Italian peninsula. Two broad coastal plains, one facing the Tyrrhenian Sea and the other the Adriatic Sea, surround the narrow Apennines south of Rome. Wild boars, wolves, asps, and bears are just a few of the many animals that call much of the lower Apennine chain's near-wilderness home. With many active volcanoes, notably Vesuvius, which occasionally vents ash and steam into the air over Naples and its island-strewn bay, the southern Apennines are also tectonically unstable.</p>
